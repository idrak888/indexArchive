			<h2>What is an Extrovert and an Introvert?</h2>
			<p>Most of you might be wondering what Extrovert and Introvert really means and which one am I?<br/>
			Well the answer isn't quite that simple.<br/>
			An Extrovert is a person who is simply very outgoing, socially active and confident.<br/>
			<img class="img-fluid" src="http://keydifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/introvert-vs-extrovert.jpg" width="500px">
			<p>Whereas, an Introvert is a type of person who is mostly just shy and recitent.<br/>
			You know you are an introvert when you don't really like crowds and you would rather stay<br/>
			home and watch TV alone.
			</p>
			<h2>How do I know which one I am?</h2>
			<p>It is pretty obvious that you are an extrovert if you like going out and socializing alot.<br/>
			Not just that, the amount of friends you have and how much you actually talk to them can<br/>
			say alot about you too.</p>
			<img class="img-fluid" src="http://commitnesstofitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Introvert-vs-Extrovert-e1375899885602-300x256.png" width="400px"><p>
				If thats you, you know you are most probably an extrovert.
			</p>
			<p>Unlike extroverts, though some introverts may like going out, they are mostly shy<br/>
			and will rarely even speak.<br/>
			Introverts tend to be inward turning as many say and will have their brains filled<br/>
			with personal thoughts.
			</p>

			<p>Well yeah, that explains most of it.</p>
			<P>At the end of the day, none of these personalities are to be judged and<br/>
			being yourself wins!</P>
			<p>I hope that helped but if you are still curious and are still not sure<br/>
			which one you are, don't be sad, take this simple test and find out your true self!</p>
